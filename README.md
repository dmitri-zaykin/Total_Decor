Total_Decor.r is a R script with sample code to compute the DOT P-value from decorrelated statistics as described in Vsevolozhskaya OA, Shi M, Hu F, Zaykin DV. DOT: "Gene-set analysis by combining decorrelated association statistics." (https://doi.org/10.1101/665133). The example reproduces TOX3 results in Tables 7,8. The input is the vector of Z-scores and the LD matrix (two CSV files). The Z-scores can be obtained from two-sided P-values (P) as Z = sqrt(qchisq(1-P, df=1)). Next, Z must be multiplied by the sign, i.e., by direction of association of the minor allele with the trait. The LD matrix is the correlation between SNP scores, coded as (0, 1, 2), where the number reflects the number of minor alleles in a genotype.

ART.r is a R sample code for Augmented RTP (ART), Adaptive ART (ART-A) and RTP via Equ. 2 from Vsevolozhskaya OA, Hu F, Zaykin DV. "Detecting weak signals by combining small P-values in genetic association studies." (https://doi.org/10.1101/667238). The code uses the TOX3 data.
